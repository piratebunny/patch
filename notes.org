Python Implementation of block programming environment for small children
 
** The Blocks Platte's
*** Control
#+begin_src python
for
while
def
with
#+end_src

*** Expression blocks
**** Operator block
#+begin_src python
+
-
*
/
//
% 
#+end_src

**** Boolian operator block
#+begin_src python
and
or
not
#+end_src
**** Comparison block
#+begin_src python
== 
!= 
> 
<
<= 
>= 
is 
is not
#+end_src

*** Data Structures
- lists
- dictionaries

*** classes
- sprite

*** Inbuilt functions
#+begin_src python
join()
len()
print()
input()
str()
int()
float()
open()
round()
#+end_src

*** Libraries
#+begin_src python
time
random
gpio
#+end_src

** Core functionality
- Drag blocks - link and nest
- Variables are defined on the fly as in Python
- Create custom blocks(functions) using Python and a simple inbuilt text editor
- Access to (some) of the standard library
- Ability to import other libraries - adds in new panels of block
- View Python code produced by blocks
- Produce custom blocks by combining other blocks or just writing standard Python
- Edit Python scripts and this is then reflected in the block code.
