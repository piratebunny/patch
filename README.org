Python Implementation of block programming environment for small children
 
** The Blocks Palattes
*** Control
#+begin_src python
for
while
def
with
#+end_src

*** Operators
#+begin_src python
+ - *  / // % ! = == > <
and or not
join 
#+end_src
*** Data Structures
- lists
- dictionaries
*** Inbuilt functions
#+begin_src python
len()
print()
input()
str()
int()
float()
open()
round()
#+end_src

*** Libraries
time
random

** Core functionality
- Drag blocks - link and nest
- Variables are defined on the fly as in Python
- Create custom blocks(functions) using Python and a simple inbuilt text editor
- Access to (some) of the standard library
- Ability to import other libraries - adds in new panels of block
- View Python code produced by blocks
- Produce custom blocks by combining other blocks or just writing standard Python
- Edit Python scripts and this is then reflected in the block code.
