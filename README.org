** Core functionality
- Drag blocks - link and nest
- Variables are defined on the fly as in Python
- Concurrency ???
- Create custom blocks(functions) using Python and a simple inbuilt text editor
- Access to (some) of the standard library
- Ability to import other libraries - adds in new panels of block
- View Python code produced by blocks
- Produce custom blocks by combining other blocks or just writing standard Python
- Edit Python scripts and this is then reflected in the block code.
