I want a nice implementation of a block programming environment
suitable for my 5 year old to use on her Raspberry Pi 2 to learn
coding.

Such software would be useful to other people on other types of
computer too.

We got together at the PyCon UK 2015 sprints to experiment with this
idea. The first step was, of course, to choose Patch the Pirate Bunny
as our mascot, because Scratch the Cat is trademarked.

The second step was to play with all the GUI toolkits and the results
are currently here. (This will be tidied up later).

There are lots of fun JavaScript things under development which we
applaud and we hope they are successful but we are trying for a pure
Python implementation, preferably that uses a toolkit that is hardware
accelerated on the Raspberry Pi.

The third step is to try out the different examples we made on the
target device so we can make an evidence based choice of the GUI
toolkit.

Steps four to one hundred will be discovered in due course.
